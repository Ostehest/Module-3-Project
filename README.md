### README - Course Project, Getting and Cleaning Data
The purpose of the course project of Module 3 "Getting and Cleaning Data" is to demonstrate the students ability to collect, work with, and clean a
data set to produce tidy data useful for further analysis.

The data and all the supplementary files for this project are produced by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto (Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012.).  

#### Objective
The objective for transforming the data was to create one R script called "run_analysis.R"" that does the following: 

1) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

The **code book** for this project describes how the data for the project was obtained and provides information about the data, variables, and summary choices.

The **script** (run_analysis.R) documents the transformation of the input data to tidy data but a supplementary **instruction list** is also added to ease interpretation and provide requirements for running of the code successfully.
